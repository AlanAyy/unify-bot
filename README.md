# unify-bot
UniFy - The discord bot that helps university students connect through Discord

## Important Update (Aug 13, 2021)
### This bot will no longer be updated since Discord recently released [School Hubs](https://gamertweak.com/school-hubs-discord/), and it will be very hard to compete with an integrated platform. It was a fun project to work on nonetheless ^^

To-Do List:
- [x] Add account verification (Email confirmation)
- [x] Store class Discord servers
- [x] Blacklist function for disruptive users
- [ ] Add moderation features
- [ ] Fun commands or smth
- [x] This is so sad. Alexa, play "Clair de Lune" by Debussy.
